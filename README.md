## Markdown Syntax

Kindly refer to this [link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for basic syntax of markdown.

| Markdown                 | HTML                        | Rendered Output |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| `# Heading level 1`      | `<h1>Heading level 1</h1>`  | Heading level 1 |
| `## Heading level 2`     | `<h2>Heading level 2</h2>`  | Heading level 2 |
| `### Heading level 3`    | `<h3>Heading level 3</h3>`  | Heading level 3 |
| `#### Heading level 4`   | `<h4>Heading level  4</h4>` | Heading level 4 |
| `##### Heading level 5`  | `<h5>Heading level 5</h5>`  | Heading level 5 |
| `###### Heading level 6` | `<h6>Heading level 6</h6>`  | Heading level 6 |

Markdown applications don‚Äôt agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (`#`) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.

| ‚úÖ Do this                              | ‚ùå Don't do this                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `          # Here's a Heading        ` | `          #Here's a Heading        ` |

You should also put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility.

| ‚úÖ Do this                                                    | ‚ùå Don't do this                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `        Try to put a blank line before...         # Heading         ...and after a heading.        ` | `        Without blank lines, this might not look right.        # Heading        Don't do this!        ` |


To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a  word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two  asterisks without spaces around the letters.

| Markdown                     | HTML                                      | Rendered Output            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `I just love **bold text**.` | `I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.` | I just love **bold text**. |
| `I just love __bold text__.` | `I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.` | I just love **bold text**. |
| `Love**is**bold`             | `Love<strong>is</strong>bold`             | Love**is**bold             |

To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a  word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one  asterisk without spaces around the letters.

| Markdown                               | HTML                                          | Rendered Output                      |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.` | `Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.` | Italicized text is the *cat‚Äôs meow*. |
| `Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.` | `Italicized text is the <em>cat's meow</em>.` | Italicized text is the *cat‚Äôs meow*. |
| `A*cat*meow`                           | `A<em>cat</em>meow`                           | A*cat*meow                           |

## Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

### Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a `>` on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Nested Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a `>>` in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Blockquotes with Other Elements

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all  elements can be used ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to experiment to see which ones work.

```
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
> *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

## $\LaTeX$ Support

Latex sytax such as `$\LaTeX$` will give an output $\LaTeX$. Single `$` means no new line, while double `$$` will produce new line such as `$$ J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \sum_{i=0} $$` and will produce $$ J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \sum_{i=0} $$ .

Another \LaTeX example such as:
```
`\[\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} &amp; = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} &amp; = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} &amp; = -\beta z + xy
\end{aligned} \]`
```

## Slide example

Make sure to create a new file such as `myslide.html`, even though the file format is in `html` you need to use Markdown syntax for the rest of your slide contents.

example:

````markdown
---
layout: slide
thumbnail: thumb_reveal.jpg
title: Sains Theme for Reveal.js
description: >-
    Reveal.js sains theme powered by Jekyll
theme: sains
highlight: monokai
